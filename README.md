The purpose of this program is to create a snake and ladder game where the user can select the number of players to play with.
The user can choose how many plays to play against.

If you reach a snake's head, you will be brought down. 
If you reach the bottom of the ladder, you will be brought up.
By reaching the snake's tain or the top of the ladder has no effects.
The first one to reach the square 100 wins!
If you pass the last square, you will be escorted to step back.
